# Paper trading

Gekko can automatically run a strategy over the live markets and simulate in realtime what happen if you would have traded on its signals. Paper trading and [backtesting](./backtesting.md) are the two simulation modes that come with Gekko. It's a great way to experiment with strategies without putting your money on the line.

You can start a paper trader by going to live gekkos and clicking on "Start a new live Gekko".

Keep in mind that a paper trader is a simulation, and the accuracy depends on the market you decide to run it on (you'll get pretty accurate results on big markets like USD/BTC). You can read more about the details and limitations of the simulation on [the backtesting page](./backtesting.md#Simplified-simulation).
