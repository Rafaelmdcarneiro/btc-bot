# Exchanges

*This is a technical document about adding a new exchange to Gekko and Gekko Broker.*

Gekko arranges all communication about when assets need to be bought or sold between the *strategy* and *Gekko Broker*. All differences between the different API's are abstracted away just below Gekko Broker inside an "exchange wrapper". This document describes all requirements for adding a new exchange wrapper (adding exchange support to Gekko).

When you add a new exchange to Gekko you need to expose an object that has methods to query the exchange. This exchange file needs to reside in `gekko/exchange/wrappers` and the filename is the slug of the exchange name + `.js`. So for example the exchange integration with Binance is explained in `gekko/exchange/wrappers/binance.js`.

Please use a npm module to query an exchange. This will separate the abstract API calls from the Gekko specific stuff (In the case of Bitstamp there was no module yet, so I [created one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitstamp)).

Finally Gekko needs to know how it can interact with the exchange, so add a static method `getCapabilities()` that returns it's properties. They are all described [here](#capabilities).

## Gekko's expectations

Gekko Broker implements an exchange like so:

    const Exchange = require('./wrapper' + [exchange slug]);
    this.exchange = new Exchange({key: '', secret: '', username: '', currency: 'USD', asset: 'BTC'});

It will run the following methods on the exchange object:

### getTrades

With this single method implemented Gekko won't be able to do live trading, but it will be able to do paper trading and storing market data for backtesting.

    this.watcher.getTrades(since, callback, descending);

If since is truthy, Gekko requests as much trades as the exchange can give (up to ~10,000 trades, if the exchange supports more you can [create an importer](../features/importing.md)).

The callback expects an error and a `trades` object. Trades is an array of trade objects in chronological order (0 is older trade, 1 is newer trade). Each trade object needs to have:

- a `date` property (unix timestamp in either string or int)
- a `price` property (float) which represents the price in [currency] per 1 [asset].
- an `amount` property (float) which represent the amount of [asset].
- a `tid` property (float) which represents the tradeID.

## Gekko Broker's expectations

The methods below are needed for Gekko to automatically trade on the exchange.

### getTicker

    this.exchange.getTicker(callback)

The callback needs to have the parameters of `err` and `ticker`. Ticker needs to be an object with at least the `bid` and `ask` property in float.

### getFee

    this.exchange.getFee(callback);

The callback needs to have the parameters of `err` and `fee`. Fee is a float that represents the amount the exchange takes out of the orders Gekko places. If an exchange has a fee of 0.2% this should be `0.002`.

### getPortfolio

    this.exchange.getPortfolio(callback);

The callback needs to have the parameters of `err` and `portfolio`. Portfolio needs to be an array of all currencies and assets combined in the form of objects, an example object looks like `{name: 'BTC', amount: 1.42131}` (name needs to be an uppercase string, amount needs to be a float).

### getLotSize

    this.exchange.getLotSize(tradeType, amount, size, callback);

The callback needs to have the parameters of `err` and `lot`. Lot needs to be an object with `amount` and `purchase` size appropriately for the exchange. In the event that the lot is too small, return 0 to both fields and this will generate a lot size warning in the portfolioManager.

Note: This function is currently optional. If not implemented Gekko Broker will fallback to basic lot sizing mechanism it uses internally. However exchanges are not all the same in how rounding and lot sizing work, it is recommend to implement this function.

### buy

    this.exchange.buy(amount, price, callback);

### sell

    this.exchange.sell(amount, price, callback);

This should create a buy / sell order at the exchange for [amount] of [asset] at [price] per 1 asset. The callback needs to have the parameters `err` and `order`. The order needs to be some id that can be passed back to `checkOrder`, `getOrder` and `cancelOrder`.

### getOrder

    this.exchange.getOrder(order, callback);

Will only be called on orders that have been completed. The order will be something that the manager previously received via the `sell` or `buy` methods. The callback should have the parameters `err` and `order`. Order is an object with properties `price`, `amount` and `date`. Price is the (volume weighted) average price of all trades necessary to execute the order. Amount is the amount of currency traded and Date is a moment object of the last trade part of this order.

### checkOrder

    this.exchange.checkOrder(order, callback);

The order will be something that the manager previously received via the `sell` or `buy` methods. The callback should have the parameters `err` and a `result` object. The result object will have two or three properties:

- `open`: whether this order is currently in the orderbook.
- `executed`: whether this order has executed (filled completely).
- `filledAmount`: the amount of the order that has been filled. This property is only needed when both `open` is true and `completed` is false.

### cancelOrder

    this.exchange.cancelOrder(order, callback);

The order will be something that the manager previously received via the `sell` or `buy` methods. The callback should have the parameters `err`, `filled` and optionally a `fill` object, `filled` should be true if the order was fully filled before it could be cancelled. If the exchange provided how much was filled before the cancel this should be passed in the `fill object` as a `amountFilled` property. If the exchange provided how much of the original amount is still remaining, pass this as the `remaining` property instead.

### roundPrice

    this.exchange.roundPrice(rawPrice);

Should return a price. Rounds the price into a valid price Gekko Broker can later feed into a buy or sell order. *Note: if representation of the number is important for the exchange (for example if the exchange will not accept numbers expressed in scientific notation) you can return a string from this method (Gekko Broker will perform calculations so the string should be castable to a number.)* 

### roundAmount

    this.exchange.roundAmount(rawAmount);

Should return an amount. Rounds the amount into a valid amount Gekko Broker can later feed into a buy or sell order. *Note: if representation of the number is important for the exchange (for example if the exchange will not accept numbers expressed in scientific notation) you can return a string from this method (Gekko Broker will perform calculations so the string should be castable to a number.)*

## Gekko Broker's optional methods

### isValidPrice

    this.exchange.isValidPrice(price);

Should return true or false. If the exchange has restrictions on the price you can submit limit orders at. If there are no such restrictions you should not implement this method.

### isValidLot

    this.exchange.isValidLot(price, amount);

Should return true or false. If the exchange has restrictions on the lot size (order size expressed in "currency" amount) you can check for that here. If there are no such restrictions you should not implement this method.

## Error handling

It is the responsibility of the wrapper to handle errors and retry the call in case of a temporary error. Gekko exposes a retry helper you can use to implement an exponential backoff retry strategy. Your wrapper does need pass a proper error object explaining whether the call can be retried or not. If the error is fatal (for example private API calls with invalid API keys) the wrapper is expected to upstream this error. If the error is retryable (exchange is overloaded or a network error) an error should be passed with the property `notFatal` set to true. If the exchange replied with another error that might be temporary (for example an `Insufficient funds` error right after Gekko canceled an order, which might be caused by the exchange not having updated the balance yet) the error object can be extended with an `retry` property indicating that the call can be retried for n times but after that the error should be considered fatal.

For implementation refer to the bitfinex implementation, in a gist this is what a common flow looks like:

- (async call) `exchange.buy`, then
- handle the response and normalize the error so the retry helper understands it, then
- the retry helper will determine whether the call needs to be retried, then
    - based on the error it will retry (for example `nonFatal` or `retry`)
    - if no error it will pass it to your handle function that normalizes the output

## Capabilities

Each exchange *must* provide a `getCapabilities()` static method that returns an object with these parameters:

- `name`: Proper name of the exchange
- `slug`: slug name of the exchange (needs to match filename in `gekko/exchanges/`)
- `currencies`: all the currencies supported by the exchange implementation in gekko.
- `assets`: all the assets supported by the exchange implementation in gekko.
- `pairs`: all allowed currency / asset combinations that form a market
- `maxHistoryFetch`: the parameter fed to the getTrades call to get the max history.
- `providesHistory`: If the getTrades can be fed a since parameter that Gekko can use to get historical data, set this to:
    - `date`: When Gekko can pass in a starting point in time to start returning data from.
    - `tid`: When Gekko needs to pass in a trade id to act as a starting point in time.
    - `false`: When the exchange does not support to give back historical data at all.
- `fetchTimespan`: if the timespan between first and last trade per fetch is fixed, set it here in minutes.
- `tradable`: if gekko supports automatic trading on this exchange.
- `requires`: if gekko supports automatic trading, this is an array of required api credentials gekko needs to pass into the constructor.
- `forceReorderDelay`: if after canceling an order a new one can't be created straight away since the balance is not updated fast enough, set this to true (only required for exchanges where Gekko can trade).
- `gekkoBroker`: set this to "0.6.2" for now, it indicates the version of Gekko Broker this wrapper is compatible with.
- `limitedCancelConfirmation` set to true if (in any case) the wrapper does NOT include partial fill information in the response (which is passed as the cancel callback)

Below is a real-case example how `bistamp` exchange provides its `getCapabilities()` method:

```
Trader.getCapabilities = function () {
  return {
    name: 'Bitstamp',
    slug: 'bitstamp',
    currencies: ['USD', 'EUR'],
    assets: ['BTC', 'EUR'],
    maxTradesAge: 60,
    maxHistoryFetch: null,
    markets: [
      { pair: ['USD', 'BTC'], minimalOrder: { amount: 1, unit: 'currency' } },
      { pair: ['EUR', 'BTC'], minimalOrder: { amount: 1, unit: 'currency' } },
      { pair: ['USD', 'EUR'], minimalOrder: { amount: 1, unit: 'currency' } }
    ],
    requires: ['key', 'secret', 'username'],
    fetchTimespan: 60,
    tid: 'tid',
    gekkoBroker: '0.6.2',
    limitedCancelConfirmation: false
  };
}
```
