# BudFox

**Similar to the [movie Wallstreet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_(1987_film)), Gekko delegates the dirty work of getting fresh data to Bud Fox. Bud Fox delivers the data to Gekko who uses this data to make investment decisions.**

Whenever Gekko works with realtime market data, it spawns a BudFox to fetch and transform the data for every market (exchange + asset + pair, for example: `bitstamp USD/BTC`). Bud Fox will keep on fetching data from the market in semi-realtime, turn historical trades into minutely candles (and make sure every minute of data has a candle).

BudFox exposes a stream of `candles` which are fed to Gekko.

## Advanced Usage

BudFox is a small part of Gekko's core that aggregates realtime market data from any supported exchange into a readable stream of candles. Example usage:

    var config = {
        exchange: 'Bitstamp',
        currency: 'USD',
        asset: 'BTC'
    }

    new BudFox(config)
      .start()
      // convert JS objects to JSON string
      .pipe(new require('stringify-stream')())
      // output to standard out
      .pipe(process.stdout);
