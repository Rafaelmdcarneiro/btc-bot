# Events

As described in the [architecture](./architecture.md) events play a key role in the complete system: they relay all information between separate components (like [plugins](./plugins.md)). This makes the codebase scalable, testable and it separates concerns.

if you run the Gekko UI events are relayed between core components as well as broadcasted (via the UI server) to the web UI. This means that all events broadcasted by any plugin automatically end up in the web UI.

Note that all events from Gekko come from a plugin (with the exception of the `candle` event, which comes from the market), and no plugin is required for Gekko to run, this means it might be possible that some events are never broadcasted since their originating plugin is not active. If a plugin wants to listen to an event that will never be broadcasted (because of a lack of another plugin) this will be warned in the console like so:

    (WARN): Paper Trader wanted to listen to the tradingAdvisor, however the tradingAdvisor is disabled.

## List of events emitted by standard plugins

- [candle](#candle-event): Every time Gekko calculates a new one minute candle from the market.
- [stratWarmupCompleted](#stratWarmupCompleted-event): When the strategy is done warming up.
- [advice](#advice-event): Every time the trading strategy has a new trading signal.
- [stratUpdate](#stratUpdate-event): Every time the strategy has processed a new strat candle.
- [stratNotification](#stratNotification-event): Every time the strategy emit new strategy notification.
- [tradeInitiated](#tradeInitiated-event): Every time a trading plugin (either the live trader or the paper trader) is going to start a new trade (buy or sell).
- [tradeCompleted](#tradeCompleted-event): Every time a trading plugin (either the live trader or the paper trader) has completed a trade.
- [tradeAborted](#tradeAborted-event): Every time a trading plugin (either the live trader or the paper trader) has NOT acted on new advice (due to insufficient funds or a similar reason).
trader) has NOT acted on new advice (due to unsufficiant funds or a similar reason).
- [tradeErrored](#tradeErrored-event): Every time the live trader was unable to execute an initialized.
- [tradeCancelled](#tradeCancelled-event): Every time the live trader cancelled a not yet executed trade.
- [portfolioChange](#portfolioChange-event): Every time the content of the portfolio has changed.

- [triggerFired](#triggerFired-event): Every time a created trigger has fired.
- [triggerAborted](#triggerAborted-event): Every time a created trigger has been aborted due to new advice.

Beside those there are also two additional market events that are only emitted when Gekko is running in realtime mode (NOT during a backtest for performance reasons).

- [marketStart](#marketStart-event): Once, when the market just started.
- [marketUpdate](#marketUpdate-event): Whenever the market has fetched new raw market data.

### candle event

- What: An object containing a one minute candle from the market.
- When: In liquid markets roughly every minute.
- Subscribe: Your plugin can subscribe to this event by registering the `processCandle` method.
- Async: When subscribing to this event the second argument will be a callback which you are expected to call when done handling this event.
- Notes:
  - Depending on the gekko configuration these candles might be historical on startup. If this is a concern for consumers, make sure to deal with this properly.
  - In illiquid markets (of less than a trade per minute) Gekko will calculate these candles in batches and a few might come at the same time.
  - These are always one minute candles, this is the lowest level of market data flowing through a gekko stream.
- Example:
      {
        start: [moment object of the start time of the candle],
        open: [number, open of candle],
        high: [number, high of candle],
        low: [number, low of candle],
        close: [number, close of candle],

  - Strat Candles are emitted while the strategy is still warming up (before the `stratWarmupCompleted` event).
- Example:
      {

        high: [number, high of candle],
        low: [number, low of candle],
        close: [number, close of candle],
