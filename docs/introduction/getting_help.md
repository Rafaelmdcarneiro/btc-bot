# Getting Help

Are you getting stuck installing or using Gekko? Are you struggling with understanding Gekko? Running into problems creating your own plugin or strategy? Do you want to discuss awesome things you want to do with Gekko? This page will explain what to do!

## Online community

If you have trouble with anything specific or you want to provide any type of feedback the online community is the place to be. You can find the community at:

1. [The online webforum](https://forum.gekko.wizb.it)
2. [The discord channel](https://discord.gg/26wMygt)

These communities are the place for things like:

- Solving installation problems
  - Solving installation errors
  - Helping set up Gekko on a server or embedded device
- Requesting/requesting new features and or changes such as:
  - New exchanges to add
  - New plugins to add
  - General new features
- Getting clarity on what Gekko can do and how it works

## Technical discussion

The links above are always the first place to go to when discussing new features. But if you've found a clear bug or you want to **keep the complete discussion 100% technical (meaning completely code and architecture related)** you can use the [bug tracker on github](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/issues). Note that we are trying to keep all other discussions out of the bug tracker to keep the whole thing manageable :)
